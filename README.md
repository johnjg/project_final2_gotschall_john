# Comments:
- List items in the navigation menu are all on one line. This is to avoid spacing issues that result when hidden linebreaks between line items combine to form a space character between navigation menu items, resulting in responsive button alignment issues. Placing the list items on one line removes the linebreaks and space characters and corrects this issue.
- My version of Atom reveals no issues at the time of submission.
